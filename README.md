# php-klanten-vertellen-api
A PHP implementation of the klantenvertellen.nl Api.

This is a PHP package which you can import in any of your PHP projects. 
The goal of this package is to make it easy to communicate with the KlantenVertellen api with just a few function calls.

## Installation

```text
composer require kennethptchr/php-klanten-vertellen-api
```

## Usage

:warning: Before you get started, make sure you already have a `token` and `location id` from the 
KlantenVertellen website.


You can get the api-token from: 

`My Account -> Invite -> Extra Options`

The ID to your review page can be found in the link on the same page as the token:

`(ex: https://www.klantenvertellen.nl/invite-link/XXXXXXX/yourcompany.nl?lang=en)`
 

### Getting started

To get started you need to create a `KlantenVertellenWrapper` object, like so:
```php
$repository = new Repository('YOUR-TOKEN-HERE', 1234, 'nl');
$wrapper = new KlantenVertellenWrapper(new GetReviews($repository), new ReviewInvite($repository));
```

#### Getting reviews
```php
//This will return 50 latest reviews that got posted on your page
$reviews = $wrapper->reviews()->getReviews(50);
   
//This will return the 25 worst reviews that got posted on your page
$worstReviews = $wrapper->reviews()->getWorstReviews();
```

#### Sending review invites
```php
//You can only send an invite to the same address every 30 days
$wrapper->inviter()->sendInvite('info@mail.com', 'First name', 'Last name');
```
